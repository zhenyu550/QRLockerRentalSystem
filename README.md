# QRLockerRentalSystem
This project is developed as a product for Workshop 2, as a course requirement of Bachelor of Computer Science (Software Development) with Honours, at Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.

QR Locker Rental System consists of 2 application, Locker Rental Management System (LRMS) and Locker Door Control Console (LDCC).

LRMS is the application to manage the rental of the lockers. A QR Code will be generated for new rentals added into the system, and will expires when the rental ends or overdues.

LDCC is the application to control the door of the locker. When the QR Code is scanned, the locker door will unlock or lock after verification and validation. The QR Locker is controlled with Arduino UNO.

This system is still a prototype and development still in progress. The QR Locker Protoype setup and configuration is not released to public.
